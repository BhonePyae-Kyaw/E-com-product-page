# Frontend Mentor - E-commerce product page solution

This is a solution to the [E-commerce product page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6). 

# Disclaimer

This site should be responsive but I don't finish the responsive part yet, since I wanted to focus more on using react router, react hook, and creating react components.
